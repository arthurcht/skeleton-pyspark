TODO
^^^^

- [ ] Testing (Which module, local testing)
- [x] README overall. needs updating but structure present
- [ ] HOWTO which contains what to expect, what it gives and how to proceed
- [x] Directory structure. Organized, but needs improvement
- [ ] Packaging (so that it also runs on the cluster).
- [x] sphinx documentation. Setup but needs fine tuning.

  + [ ] howto_link.rst is real ugly. See if it can be fixed
  + [ ] Combine the Makefile of docs with regular Makefile?
- [ ] mypy
- [ ] GitHub action
  + [ ] What needs to be in here? pytest
- [ ] Makefile
- [ ] code coverage
- [ ] logging
- [ ] tox
